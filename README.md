# MIPS Microarchitecture Implementations
##### This is a centralized "directory" of my various implementations of MIPS microarchitectures. 

 :warning: This is not done as part of a class. I really enjoy learning about computer architecture and the interaction between hardware and software. If you are looking for an intern to do something along these lines for the summer 2020 please get in contact!

### Current MIPS Projects:

[Single Cycle 32 bit MIPS](https://github.com/braamBeresford/32bitMipsSingleCycle)

### Non MIPS Projects:
[Pong outputted to VGA](https://github.com/braamBeresford/systemVerilogPong)
